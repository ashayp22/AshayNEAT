how much of this code is mine vs what other people wrote:
- I have written all of the code, partly because there aren't java implementations of the algorithm and I won't learn anything by copying and pasting code
- The ideas I got for creating the whole hierarchy comes from descriptions of methods and classes I should incorporate, along with snippets of code in different languages part of the most important methods and pre/post conditions from the sources
    
how to implement:
- copy these files to your project
- create a Main class that has the parameters found in parameters.txt
- start training
